title: "Error response format"
description: "Orb's error response format follows [RFC7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807). Each error response includes:"
---

* `status`: Same as the HTTP status code
* `title`: Brief description of the error message
* `type`: URI that always links to this document for further reference
* `detail`: Human readable description providing more insight into the error

Note that error responses may include other keys specific to the error.

```json
{
    "detail": "Could not find a resource of type Plan with identifier: DBhwNcMNfYgeBpn.",
    "status": 404,
    "title": "A specified resource was not found.",
    "type": "https://docs.withorb.com/reference/error-responses#404-resource-not-found"
}

```

The following table describes the error types. If you are processing an error programatically, consider using the `type` URI along with the status code. The `type` URI is a stable identifier for the class of error.
