title: "Pagination"
description: "The Orb API implements cursor-based pagination on endpoints that list resources, such as the [List Customers](/reference/list-customers) endpoint. This makes it easy to incrementally load resources in the Orb API without the transfer of excessive amounts of data in one round trip."

At a high level, cursor-based pagination employs string tokens in the request and response to indicate reference points in the returned list.

## Paginated API responses[](#paginated-api-responses "Direct link to heading")

List endpoints utilize a standardized format that contains the requested list in a `data` response object, as well as some _metadata_ that's useful for pagination in the `pagination_metadata` response object.

Generically, the response format is:

```json
{
    "data": [
       ...
    ],
    "pagination_metadata": {
        "has_more": true,
        "next_cursor": "..."
    }
}

```

A few notes on this returned result:

* `has_more` will be `true` if there are more results that were not returned by this endpoint due to the `limit` value set.
* `next_cursor` is a string value that will be non-`null` if `has_more` is `true`. This value should be provided to the same endpoint in a subsequent call to fetch more results, maintaining the same sort order.

When `has_more=True`, pass the `next_cursor` response as the `cursor` query parameter to fetch the next page of results. 

By default, paginated resources are sorted from most recently created to least recently created, determined by the `created_at` field on each resource.

## Limits[](#limits "Direct link to heading")

Orb implements a default page size of 20, with a maximum upper bound of 500 items per request. The number of items requested can be specified by passing in the `limit` query parameter to a paginated request.
