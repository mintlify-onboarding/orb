Follow the Quickstart guide to get up and running with Orb, and go through the process of ingesting your first usage events, creating your first metric, and subscribing your customer to a sample plan.

Throughout the quickstart, we recommend that you work in Orb's test mode in order to avoid any undesirable side-effects of your actions. Note that the test mode environment is a completely isolated environment from your production environment and uses a different set of API credentials, so you can safely experiment with Orb without affecting your production data. To switch to test mode, toggle the top banner in the Orb UI until the banner reads "Test mode" and is highlighted in green.
