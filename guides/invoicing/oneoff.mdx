title: "Create one-off invoices"
---

For one-time or ad-hoc charges your customers may incur, you can create one-off invoices. One-off invoices inherit all the capabilities of invoices created from subscriptions and can be created via the dashboard or the API.

In the dashboard, navigate to the invoices page and click "+ New Invoice" at the top right. You can also enter this flow from the invoice section of a specific customer page.

Fill in any invoice details and line items. As you add and edit line items, the invoice subtotals and totals will automatically update.

Upon clicking "Save", you will be guided to a draft version of the invoice where you can review the totals before you decide to issue. Once manually issued, any configurations regarding auto-collection and email delivery will be inherited from your account settings.
