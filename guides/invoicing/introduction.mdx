In addition to Orb's billing functionality, Orb also features a fully native invoicing solution. Orb Invoicing allows you to run the entirety of your revenue operations workflow without relying on an external system for collections. It serves as a replacement for tools like Stripe Invoicing or Bill.com, and provides invoices with richer detail and transparency.

Orb Invoicing is also the basis for Orb’s reporting functionality, allowing you to trace from a single usage event to a dollar that your business receives.

Orb Invoicing is built on a few key principles:

1. **Accuracy first**: Invoices are directly integrated with the underlying billing engine, ensuring that the your invoice reflects your plan structure and line items are derived from your event data. The ability to adjust invoices ensures that Orb remains the source of truth for the invoices your customers receive.
2. **Transparency by default**: By default, the invoice Orb issues to your customers is as clear as what you see internally. Orb’s invoices show rich graphs of day-by-day utilization, not simply a series of static line items. This visibility decrease surprises for your customer-facing teams, and helps your customers understand how they’re being charged for your product.
3. **Clear, not clever**: Hybrid billing models can be sophisticated — often featuring prices with different cadences, variable usage over time, levers like discounts and minimums, and even pre-purchase drawdowns. Throughout the product, Orb ensures that this information is displayed in a digestible format.
