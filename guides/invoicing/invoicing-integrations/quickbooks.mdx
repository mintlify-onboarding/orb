## Mapping items[](#mapping-items "Direct link to heading")

Mapping items to items in QuickBooks is required for the integration to succeed. If you do not map items, invoices will fail to issue.

In QuickBooks, Items are called Products and Services, and can be found in the Get paid and pay menu (direct link [https://app.qbo.intuit.com/app/items](https://app.qbo.intuit.com/app/items)). Create a product or service in QuickBooks for every item that you are selling in Orb. 

Then, navigate to the Items tab in Orb under Settings, and select a QuickBooks item for each Orb item.

## Configuring customers[](#configuring-customers "Direct link to heading")

When creating or updating customers in the Orb UI, select QuickBooks as the Payment Provider in order to view a list of previously created customers in your QuickBooks account. 

Customer mappings can also be configured in the API, by passing in the customer’s QuickBooks ID under `payment_provider_id`, and setting `payment_provider` to `quickbooks`. The customer’s QuickBooks ID can be found by navigating to the customer’s page in QuickBooks, and copying the ID from the URL (e.g. `https://app.qbo.intuit.com/app/customerdetail?nameId=377`, where `377` is the ID)

Once mappings are configured, invoices for customers with a QuickBooks payment provider ID will be synced to QuickBooks.
