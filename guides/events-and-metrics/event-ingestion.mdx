title: "Ingest usage events"
---

Use the [Ingest Usage Events](/reference/ingest) endpoint to send usage events into Orb. Orb operates on the paradigm of [events-based billing](/guides/events-and-metrics/construct-metrics), where usage is calculated over raw events data. If you're looking to get started with sending your first event to Orb, check out the [Ingestion Quickstart Guide](/guides/quickstart/ingest).

## Events and metrics[](#events-and-metrics "Direct link to heading")

A single usage event sent to Orb typically corresponds to either a user-triggered action or an axis of measurement, depending on your business. Each event is labeled with an `event_name`, which conceptually identifies the action taken, as well as a user-defined dictionary of `properties`. Metrics are assembled by querying over events (of potentially different `event_name`), and can flexibly filter and aggregate on any property of the underlying events.

The following table provides some examples of events you might send to Orb based on the nature of your business, to illustrate how broadly an event can vary. In each case, the `properties` that you send alongside these names will determine your event's full semantics.

| Business Domain             | Event examples                                                        |

## Event volume and concurrency[](#event-volume-and-concurrency "Direct link to heading")

Orb’s [ingestion API](/reference/ingest) is designed to manage high-volume, real-time use cases. Each individual call supports sending a batch of events. Individual ingestion requests can also be sent concurrently, which is useful in environments with multiple distributed reporters sending data to Orb that don’t require coordination. Orb provides per-event idempotency through the API to guarantee that duplicates are never processed. By default, Orb limits the request size to 500 events per batch.

Please give our team a heads up if you plan to continuously send over 10,000 events per minute, so that we may provision dedicated throughput capacity. The ingestion API (regardless of the integration mechanism) is designed to scale to tens of millions of events per day. If your use case requires more event capacity, Orb offers a [high throughput option](/guides/events-and-metrics/high-throughput-ingestion) that performs rollups and scales to orders of magnitude more events while still providing the same idempotency and real-time guarantees.

To ensure that test mode workloads do not affect live mode availability or performance, the ingestion API will be limited to 1000 events per minute and 500 requests per minute for test mode events. Note that significantly higher throughput, by orders of magnitude, is available in production environments.

## Determining event schema[](#determining-event-schema "Direct link to heading")

Metadata passed in via `properties` to Orb does not have to conform to an up-front decided schema, and you can specify any number of tags or labels that might be relevant to billing. Each event should include properties required to compute an aggregate on the basis of those events.

You're encouraged to send additional metadata, even if it's not immediately useful for billing in the short-term. Additional event properties may be used for future metrics you want to build, or formatting invoices (e.g. if you provide a `region` property that doesn't affect prices, your invoices may still employ it for grouping line items). Sending those properties in your initial integration will help avoid backfills and amendments.

In the Financial APIs use case above, the entirety of the event might look like:

```
{
  "event_name": "transaction_processed"
  "timestamp": "2022-02-02T00:00:00Z",
  "external_customer_id": "9fc80ac0-d9ff-11ec-9d64-0242ac120002"
  "properties": {
    "processing_status": "succeeded",
    "transaction_amount": 3513.36
    "payment_method": "ach"
  }
}

```

For an infrastructure service, on the other hand, the event might include properties that explain the compute incurred:

```
{
  "event_name": "cluster_compute"
  "timestamp": "2022-02-02T00:00:00Z",
  "external_customer_id": "9fc80ac0-d9ff-11ec-9d64-0242ac120002"
  "properties": {
    "cluster_name": "staging-cluster-1",
    "compute_ms": 912
    "aws_region": "us-east-1",
    "compute_tier": "async_tier_2"
  }
}

```

## Tracing ingested events[](#tracing-ingested-events "Direct link to heading")

Events themselves can be inspected in Orb via a trace view. This can be helpful for understanding how events are being processed, or in order to test your integration.

This view includes:

* A full view of the event, including the `properties` that were sent with the original payload
* Attribution information to the Orb Customer
* Information about whether the event contributed to an active subscription, and if it led to a deduction for pre-paid plans
* How the event contributed to the invoicing cycle, past or upcoming

## Integrations for event ingestion[](#integrations-for-event-ingestion "Direct link to heading")

Orb supports multiple different ingestion strategies to maximize the ease and efficiency of your integration. In addition to the primary ingestion endpoint, events can also be ingested via the following integrations.
